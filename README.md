- 👋 Hi, I’m @beatsch
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming a freelance web designer
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to prebuilt my website
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on websites, pyhton, C++, and other cool creative fun projects! 
- 📫 How to reach me: insta is the easiest I guess just message: @beacarolyn  

Soon I will be done with this project and my BsC in CompiSci and I will link my soon to be personal website where you can reach out for all your web design, application wishes!
I am always eager to learn and try out new things!
